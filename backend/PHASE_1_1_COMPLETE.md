# Phase 1.1 Complete: Error Handlers Integration

## What Changed

1. âœ… Created `/backend/src/core/error_handlers.py` (new file)
2. âœ… Updated `/backend/src/fantasy_api.py`:
   - Added import: `from core.error_handlers import setup_error_handlers`
   - Added setup call after CORS middleware
   - Commented out old exception handlers

## Test It Now

### Step 1: Build and deploy

```bash
cd /home/strakajagr/projects/dynasty-dugout/backend
sam build
sam deploy
```

### Step 2: Test the error handlers work

```bash
# Test a good endpoint (should work normally)
curl https://13cpdms4x1.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Prod/api/health

# Test an endpoint that doesn't exist (should return new error format)
curl https://13cpdms4x1.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Prod/api/nonexistent

# Run smoke tests
cd /home/strakajagr/projects/dynasty-dugout
python3 tests/smoke_tests.py
```

### Step 3: Use the new error classes in your endpoints

Example - edit any router file like `routers/players.py`:

```python
# OLD WAY:
from fastapi import HTTPException

@router.get("/players/{player_id}")
async def get_player(player_id: int):
    player = get_player_from_db(player_id)
    if not player:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Player not found")
    return player

# NEW WAY:
from core.error_handlers import PlayerNotFoundError

@router.get("/players/{player_id}")
async def get_player(player_id: int):
    player = get_player_from_db(player_id)
    if not player:
        raise PlayerNotFoundError(player_id)  # Much cleaner!
    return player
```

## Error Response Format

All errors now return this consistent format:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "message": "Player with ID '12345' not found",
    "type": "PlayerNotFoundError",
    "details": {
      "resource_type": "Player",
      "resource_id": "12345"
    }
  }
}
```

## Next Step

Once you've tested and verified the error handlers work:
- Update health check endpoint to show error handlers are active
- Start using the new error classes in one router
- Deploy and test again

## Ready for Phase 1.2?

Once this is working, we'll add:
- Response models (type safety + auto-documentation)
- Frontend error boundary
- Mobile-responsive component

You're making progress! ðŸš€
