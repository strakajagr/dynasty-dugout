---

## 🏗️ Core Design Tenets

### **1. Single Source of Truth**
- **All styling flows through `dynastyTheme`** - Zero hardcoded colors or CSS classes
- **API calls centralized in `apiService.js`** - All backend communication in one place
- **Database-per-league architecture** - Each league gets its own PostgreSQL database for scalability

### **2. Separation of Concerns**
- **Frontend**: Pure React components using design system
- **Backend**: API services with no UI logic
- **Infrastructure**: CloudFront + API Gateway + Lambda + PostgreSQL

### **3. Data Architecture**
- **MLB Data**: Single source of truth in main PostgreSQL database
- **League Data**: Separate databases with foreign key references to MLB data
- **No Data Duplication**: MLB stats updated once, accessed by all leagues

---

## 🎨 Frontend Architecture

### **Unified Design System (100% Complete)**

```javascript
// src/services/colorService.js - SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH
import { dynastyTheme } from '../services/colorService';

// Everything flows through dynastyTheme:
dynastyTheme.tokens.colors.primary        // Raw design values
dynastyTheme.classes.text.white          // Utility classes  
dynastyTheme.components.card.base        // Pre-built components
dynastyTheme.utils.getComponent()        // Dynamic component generation
```

**✅ Transformed Files:**
- **Core Services**: `colorService.js`, `tableService.js`, `apiService.js`
- **Components**: `LeagueSettings.js`, `AuthModal.js` (unified design system)
- **Pages**: All major pages (`LandingPage.js`, `Dashboard.js`, `CreateLeague.js`, etc.)

**Usage Pattern:**
```javascript
// ✅ CORRECT - Every component follows this pattern:
import { dynastyTheme } from '../services/colorService';

<div className={dynastyTheme.components.card.base}>
<button className={dynastyTheme.utils.getComponent('button', 'primary', 'md')}>

// ❌ NEVER DO THIS:
// Hard-coded colors, dynasty-specific CSS classes, inline styles
```

## 🗄️ Database Architecture: MLB Data + League Separation

### **Core Architectural Decision**

**CRITICAL DESIGN PRINCIPLE**: Separate MLB statistical data from league-specific data to achieve optimal scalability, data consistency, and cost efficiency.

### **Main MLB Database (Single Source of Truth)**
```sql
-- Database: "postgres" (existing)
-- Purpose: MLB statistical data, updated daily
-- Access: Read-only for leagues

Tables:
├── mlb_players (player_id, first_name, last_name, position, mlb_team, jersey_number)
├── player_stats (player_id, season, batting_avg, home_runs, rbi, era, wins, saves)
├── player_game_logs (player_id, game_date, performance_metrics)
├── player_career_stats (player_id, career_totals)
├── mlb_games (game_id, date, teams, scores)
├── mlb_teams (team_id, team_name, abbreviation)
└── user_profiles (user_id, date_of_birth, profile_picture_url, preferences)

Daily Update Process:
1. Fetch previous day's game data from MLB API
2. Update player_game_logs table
3. Recalculate 2025 season stats
4. Calculate quality starts (6+ innings, ≤3 earned runs)
5. Update player_stats table
```

### **League Databases (League-Specific Data Only)**
```sql
-- Database Pattern: "league_{league_id}" (one per league)
-- Purpose: League-specific player data and league management
-- Access: Full read/write for league operations

Tables:
├── league_players (
    league_player_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    mlb_player_id INTEGER,  -- Foreign key to postgres.mlb_players.player_id
    team_id UUID,           -- Which fantasy team owns this player
    salary DECIMAL(8,2),    -- League-specific salary
    contract_years INTEGER, -- Contract length
    roster_status VARCHAR(20), -- 'active', 'bench', 'injured', 'available'
    position_eligibility TEXT[], -- League position rules
    acquisition_date TIMESTAMP,
    acquisition_method VARCHAR(20) -- 'draft', 'trade', 'waiver', 'free_agent'
)
├── league_teams (team_id, user_id, team_name, manager_name, wins, losses)
├── league_transactions (transaction_id, league_player_id, from_team_id, to_team_id, type)
├── league_standings (standings_id, team_id, category, value, rank, points)
└── league_settings (setting_id, league_id, setting_name, setting_value)
```

### **Why This Architecture**

**✅ Benefits:**
- **Data Consistency**: Single source of truth for MLB data
- **Storage Efficiency**: No duplication of MLB statistics (99% storage reduction)
- **Update Performance**: Daily updates happen once, not 1000+ times
- **Scalability**: Linear scaling (1000 leagues = 1000 small databases + 1 MLB database)
- **Cost Optimization**: Dramatic reduction in storage and compute costs

**❌ Rejected Approach (Full Database Replication):**
```
Main MLB DB → Copy to League DB #1 (full replica)
            → Copy to League DB #2 (full replica)  
            → ... (1000+ full replicas)
```
This would result in 1000x storage costs and massive daily update operations.

### **Application Layer Data Joining**

```python
def get_league_player_with_mlb_stats(league_id: str, mlb_player_id: int) -> dict:
    """
    Get complete player data: MLB stats + league-specific data
    Users see both historical stats AND league contract info
    """
    # Get league-specific data from league database
    league_data = execute_sql(
        "SELECT salary, contract_years, roster_status FROM league_players WHERE mlb_player_id = :id",
        parameters={'player_id': mlb_player_id},
        database_name=f"league_{league_id}"
    )
    
    # Get MLB stats from main database
    mlb_data = execute_sql(
        "SELECT first_name, last_name, position, batting_avg, home_runs FROM mlb_players p LEFT JOIN player_stats s ON p.player_id = s.player_id WHERE p.player_id = :id AND s.season = 2025",
        parameters={'player_id': mlb_player_id},
        database_name="postgres"
    )
    
    # Combine both datasets - users see everything in one view
    return {**league_data[0], **mlb_data[0]}
```

## 🔧 Current Development Status: League Creation System

### **🚨 ACTIVE DEBUGGING: Schema Creation Issues**

**Current Issue (July 24, 2025):**
The league creation system is experiencing schema setup problems after recent architecture changes.

**Progress So Far:**
- ✅ **Database Creation**: Working correctly (creates `league_{id}` databases)
- ✅ **Multistatement Fix**: Fixed RDS Data API multistatement limitation 
- ✅ **Table Name Alignment**: Fixed `players` vs `league_players` mismatch
- ❌ **Column Mismatch**: Current issue with INSERT statement column alignment

**Latest Error (20:03:33 UTC):**
```
ERROR: column "first_name" of relation "league_players" does not exist
SQL: INSERT INTO league_players (mlb_player_id, first_name, last_name, position, mlb_team, jersey_number, is_active, salary, contract_years, roster_status, position_eligibility)
```

**Root Cause:**
The `league_player_service.py` is trying to insert MLB data columns (`first_name`, `last_name`, `position`, `mlb_team`, `jersey_number`) into the league database, but our new architecture only stores league-specific data (`mlb_player_id`, `salary`, `contract_years`, `roster_status`, `position_eligibility`) in league databases.

**Required Fix:**
Update the INSERT statement in `src/league_services/league_player_service.py` to only insert league-specific columns:

```python
# WRONG (current - trying to duplicate MLB data)
INSERT INTO league_players (mlb_player_id, first_name, last_name, position, mlb_team, jersey_number, is_active, salary, contract_years, roster_status, position_eligibility)

# CORRECT (needed - only league-specific data)
INSERT INTO league_players (mlb_player_id, salary, contract_years, roster_status, position_eligibility)
```

**League Creation Flow Status:**
1. ✅ **"Preparing league creation"** - Working
2. ✅ **"Creating league database"** - Working (creates separate database)
3. ✅ **"Configuring database schema"** - Working (creates tables and indexes)
4. ❌ **"Loading MLB player pool"** - Failing on column mismatch
5. ⏳ **"Finalizing league setup"** - Not reached yet

### **Recent Fixes Applied:**

**1. RDS Data API Multistatement Issue (Fixed)**
- **Problem**: RDS Data API doesn't support multiple SQL statements in one call
- **Solution**: Execute each index creation separately instead of combined SQL string
- **Status**: ✅ Resolved

**2. Table Name Mismatch (Fixed)**
- **Problem**: Service code referenced old `players` table, schema used `league_players`
- **Solution**: Updated all references in `league_player_service.py` using sed commands
- **Status**: ✅ Resolved

**3. Column Schema Alignment (In Progress)**
- **Problem**: INSERT statement includes MLB columns not present in league schema
- **Solution**: Update INSERT to only include league-specific columns
- **Status**: 🔧 Next fix required

### **Database Creation Technical Implementation**

**Key Constraint**: RDS Data API doesn't support `CREATE DATABASE` operations directly.

**Solution**: Execute `CREATE DATABASE` on the `postgres` system database:
```python
def create_league_database(league_id: str) -> dict:
    db_name = f"league_{league_id.replace('-', '_')}"
    create_db_sql = f'CREATE DATABASE "{db_name}"'
    # Execute on 'postgres' system database (not main app database)
    execute_sql(create_db_sql, database_name='postgres')
```

**Schema Creation**: Each SQL statement must be executed separately due to RDS Data API limitations:
```python
# Each table and index created individually
execute_sql(create_league_players_table, database_name=db_name)
execute_sql(create_league_teams_table, database_name=db_name)
# ... etc for each table and index
```
