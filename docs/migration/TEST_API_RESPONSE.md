# Backend API Testing - See What's ACTUALLY Being Returned

## The Problem
Your tabs are empty because the backend API isn't returning the analytics data that the frontend expects.

## Quick Test - Check Console Logs

1. Open a player profile in your deployed app
2. Open browser DevTools (F12)
3. Look at the Console tab
4. You should see log messages from `usePlayerData.js` like:
   ```
   === usePlayerData Debug ===
   All fields from API: [...]
   ```

## What to Look For

The console logs will show you EXACTLY what the `/api/players/{playerId}/complete` endpoint is returning.

### Expected Structure:
```javascript
{
  player: {
    info: {...},
    stats: {
      season: {...},
      rolling_14_day: {...},
      career_stats: [...],
      career_totals: {...},
      game_logs: [...]
    },
    analytics: {
      hot_cold: {...},
      position_rankings: [...],
      year_over_year: [...],
      monthly_splits: [...],
      z_scores: {...},
      performance_trends: {...},
      // etc
    }
  }
}
```

### Most Likely Issue:
**The `analytics` object is probably EMPTY or MISSING entirely**

## Backend API Endpoints to Check

Your frontend expects these endpoints to return data:

1. **Main Player Data:**
   - GET `/api/players/{playerId}/complete`
   - Should return: player info, stats, game logs, career stats, AND analytics

2. **Game Logs Tile Analytics:**
   - GET `/api/players/{playerId}/analytics/hitter-tile` (for hitters)
   - GET `/api/players/{playerId}/analytics/pitcher-tile` (for pitchers)

## Manual API Test

Test your backend directly:

```bash
# Test the complete endpoint
curl https://your-backend-url.com/api/players/660271/complete

# Look for the analytics section - is it there? Is it empty?
```

## The Fix

The issue is **NOT in the frontend code**. The frontend IS correctly:
- Using snake_case field names
- Passing data between components properly
- Looking for the right fields

**The issue is your BACKEND isn't returning analytics data.**

You need to check:
1. Does your backend `/complete` endpoint include analytics?
2. Are the analytics endpoints (`/analytics/hitter-tile`, `/analytics/pitcher-tile`) implemented?
3. Is your backend calculating these analytics correctly?

## Next Steps

1. **Check the console logs** in your deployed app - see what the API actually returns
2. **Test the backend API directly** - does it return analytics?
3. **Fix the backend** to return the expected analytics structure

The frontend code is correct. This is a backend API issue.
