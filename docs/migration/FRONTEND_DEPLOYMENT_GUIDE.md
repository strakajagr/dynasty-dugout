# üöÄ FRONTEND DEPLOYMENT GUIDE

## STATUS: READY TO DEPLOY
**Date:** January 2025  
**Critical Fix:** usePlayerData.js now uses backend field names (snake_case)

---

## ‚ö° QUICK FIX DEPLOYMENT (RECOMMENDED - 5 Minutes)

### What This Fixes
- **ERROR:** `Cannot read properties of undefined` in player profile pages
- **ROOT CAUSE:** Frontend expected `seasonStats` (camelCase), backend returns `season_stats` (snake_case)
- **SOLUTION:** Updated usePlayerData hook to use backend field names

### Deployment Steps

```bash
# 1. Navigate to your project
cd ~/projects/dynasty-dugout/frontend-react

# 2. Verify the fix is in place
cat src/hooks/usePlayerData.js | grep "season_stats"
# Should see: const [season_stats, setSeasonStats] = useState(null);

# 3. Build the frontend
npm run build

# 4. Deploy (choose your method)

## Option A: AWS Amplify (if using)
amplify publish

## Option B: SAM Deployment
cd ..
sam build
sam deploy

## Option C: Manual S3 Upload
aws s3 sync frontend-react/build/ s3://your-bucket-name/ --delete

## Option D: CloudFront Invalidation (if needed)
aws cloudfront create-invalidation \
  --distribution-id YOUR_DISTRIBUTION_ID \
  --paths "/*"
```

### Verification After Deployment

1. **Open your app** in a browser
2. **Navigate to a player profile** page
3. **Check browser console** (F12 > Console)
4. **Look for:**
   - ‚úÖ No "Cannot read properties of undefined" errors
   - ‚úÖ Player stats displaying correctly
   - ‚úÖ Tabs working (Overview, Game Logs, Career, etc.)

### Expected Console Output
```
=== usePlayerData Debug ===
All fields from API: [...includes season_stats, rolling_14_day, etc...]
Has player object: true
Successfully loaded player data
```

## üìä TESTING CHECKLIST

### Manual Testing
- [ ] Player profile page loads without errors
- [ ] Overview tab displays season stats
- [ ] Game Logs tab shows recent games
- [ ] Career tab displays historical data
- [ ] Performance Analytics tab works
- [ ] Contract tab displays (in league context)
- [ ] No console errors in browser DevTools

### Automated Testing (if applicable)
```bash
npm test
```

### Integration Testing
```bash
# Test specific player profile
# Open: http://your-app-url/player/:playerId
# Replace :playerId with actual MLB player ID
```

---

## üêõ TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: Still seeing "undefined" errors

**Solution:**
```bash
# Clear browser cache
# Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)

# Check if old build is cached
rm -rf frontend-react/build
npm run build
```

### Issue: API returns different field names

**Check API Response:**
```bash
# Test API directly
curl https://your-api-url/api/players/PLAYER_ID/complete

# Look for field names in response:
# - season_stats (correct backend name)
# - seasonStats (old camelCase - API needs update)
```

If API returns camelCase, you need to update the **backend** Lambda functions.

### Issue: Some components still broken

**Verify all imports:**
```bash
# Search for any remaining camelCase usage
grep -r "seasonStats\|rollingStats" frontend-react/src/

# Should return: No matches (or only in comments)
```

---

## üîÑ ROLLBACK PROCEDURE

If deployment causes issues:

```bash
# 1. Revert to previous deployment
git log --oneline  # Find previous commit
git checkout <previous-commit-hash>

# 2. Rebuild and redeploy
npm run build
sam deploy

# 3. Or restore from backup
aws s3 sync s3://your-backup-bucket/ frontend-react/build/
```
