## 🔥 Critical Item

### ⚠️ Production is Currently Broken

**Error:** `Database error: column "p_is_active" does not exist`  
**Affected:** All player search/listing endpoints  
**User Impact:** Cannot search for players (500 error)

**Fix Status:**
- ✅ Root cause identified (SQL used `p.active`, database has `p.is_active`)
- ✅ Code fixed in 6 locations
- ❌ **NOT DEPLOYED YET** ← This is blocking production

**Deploy Now:**
```bash
cd ~/projects/dynasty-dugout/backend
sam build && sam deploy
```

---

## ✅ What's Been Accomplished

### This Session (Oct 1)
1. **Debugged Production Issue** - Traced 500 errors to database schema mismatch
2. **Fixed 6 SQL Queries** - Changed `p.active` → `p.is_active as active`
3. **Created Comprehensive Docs** - 4 new handoff documents
4. **Prepared Deployment** - Ready to fix production in 5 minutes

### Previous Sessions (Sept 23-30)
1. **Error Handlers** - Centralized error handling (deployed & working)
2. **Canonical Structure** - Standardized player data format (code complete)
3. **New Endpoints** - 5 canonical player endpoints (need deployment)
4. **Frontend Prep** - Updated apiService.js with canonical methods

## 🎓 What You Need to Know

### The Problem We're Solving
**Before:** Player IDs were a mess
- Sometimes `player.player_id`
- Sometimes `player.mlb_player_id`
- Sometimes `player.id`
- Frontend had to check all three

**After:** Consistent structure everywhere
- Always `player.ids.mlb`
- Clear separation of contexts
- Multi-league support

### The Architecture
```
mlb_players table (main database)
    ↓ Column: is_active (NOT active!)
    ↓
Canonical Queries (canonical_player.py)
    ↓ Aliases: is_active as active
    ↓
API Endpoints (players_canonical.py)
    ↓ Returns: { ids: { mlb: X }, info: {...} }
    ↓
Frontend (apiService.js)
    ↓ Calls: playersAPI.searchPlayers()
    ↓
React Components
    └─ Uses: player.ids.mlb
```

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### After Deployment
```bash
# 1. Test player search (should return 200)
curl "https://13cpdms4x1.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Prod/api/players/search?q=Trout"

# 2. Test health check (should be healthy)  
curl "https://13cpdms4x1.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Prod/api/health"

# 3. Check logs (should have no errors)
aws logs tail /aws/lambda/FantasyBaseballApi --follow

# 4. Test in browser (should search successfully)
# Open Dynasty Dugout app → Search for a player
```

---

## ⚡ Quick Commands

```bash
# Navigate to project
cd ~/projects/dynasty-dugout

# Check status
cat docs/START_HERE_NOW.md

# Deploy backend
cd backend && sam build && sam deploy

# Test endpoints
curl "https://13cpdms4x1.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Prod/api/players/search?q=Trout" | jq

# View logs
aws logs tail /aws/lambda/FantasyBaseballApi --follow

# Commit changes
git add backend/src/core/canonical_player.py backend/src/routers/players_canonical.py
git commit -m "Fix: Database column mismatch"
git push
```

## 💡 Key Insights

### What Went Well
- ✅ Systematic debugging approach worked
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation created
- ✅ Fix is simple and low-risk
- ✅ Clear handoff process established

### What Could Be Better
- ⚠️ Should have validated database schema before writing queries
- ⚠️ Should have tested in dev environment first
- ⚠️ Should have smoke tests running in CI/CD

### Lessons Learned
1. Always verify actual database schema
2. Test locally before deploying
3. Document as you go (not after)
4. Small deployments are less risky

## 📞 Handoff Instructions

### For Next Session (or Tomorrow You)

**Say this to Claude:**
```
I'm resuming Dynasty Dugout work. We fixed the database schema bug 
(is_active vs active) but haven't deployed yet. 

Status check:
[paste output from: curl "https://API/api/players/search?q=Trout"]

What I want to do:
[ ] Deploy the fix
[ ] Test endpoints  
[ ] Update frontend pages
[ ] Something else: _______

See docs/START_HERE_NOW.md for context.
```
